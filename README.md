# net.github.fofix

Forked from the Flatpak for regular Frets on Fire. I was working on it for a while, and got it to start, but it wouldn't play any songs. Said it attempted to write to a readonly database. 
And now I don't have the time to work on it anymore. Feel free use as a basis for any future work.
